# HTTP API reference

!!! warning "Deny-by-default authentication"
    Every published operation requires a valid OIDC bearer access token
    unless its `Auth` column reads `Public`. Authorization is deny-by-default:
    a principal holds only the roles explicitly granted to it, and any service
    surface outside the public tier is internal and is never published here.
    Obtain a token with the OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE flow (see the Auth
    setup page) and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
